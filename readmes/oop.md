# OOP

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is wrapping data and methods that act on that data and is often used to hide whats going on under the hood. It lets us reuse functionality without compromising its security. 
This pertains to naming variable classes and methods as Private public and protected. 
This helps with readability.
##### Advantages of encapsulation:
* Data hiding
    * Because the of private setting the user will not have an understanding to the inner workings of the class.
    they will only know what we tell them about how to initialize/retrieve data.  
* Increased flexibility
    * make read only by only generating getter methods.
    * make write only by generating only setter methods.
    * make read write by generating both getters and setters.
* Reusability
* Makes testing easier 
#### Example
 A class encapsulates an object which is a collection of data and methods that act upon that data,
where a class is  a template of and defines the object 
Class vs object resource

## Abstraction
Helps keep code dry and makes simple things easy to use and reusable across many applications.
Abstraction generally means that objects, classes, and variables can represent more complex underlying
code and data. Generally the underlying attributes are not necessary to understand in order to use
the data type/data structure. 
###### "Abstraction refers to the act of representing important and special features without including the background details or explanation about that feature. Data abstraction simplifies database design." - Geeks for geeks.

#### Example
While using the an hashmap, it is necessary to understand the parameters and methods surrounding the data structure,
but it is not necessary to know how everything is working under the hood in order to implement it. in this way abstraction
can be aid in using other peoples code and methods with only knowing the basics of how to use it.
 
## Inheritance
Inheritance is where a child classes share attributes of the parent class this concept is also about writing dry code.
Polymorphism
Polymorphism means many forms and lets us use the same word/method depending on the context. Overriding /overloading are great examples of this
Overriding is when different meanings are implied by values of the supplied variables. For example, a parent and child class have the same method declared the child class method is said to override the parent method.
